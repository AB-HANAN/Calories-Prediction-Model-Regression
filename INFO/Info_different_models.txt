What is RMSE?
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.

It calculates the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.


Why Should RMSE Be Low?
Lower RMSE = Better Model Accuracy (predictions are closer to actual values).

Higher RMSE = Larger Errors (model predictions deviate significantly from true values).

It penalizes large errors more heavily due to the squaring step, making it sensitive to outliers.
